                    <span className="font-semibold">Mr. Kahafil Ora</span>, an IT specialist, first founded the codeinnovior youtube channel in the year 2020 with the intention of sharing his knowledge and experience with his professional colleagues around the world. Within a few months, he began to receive very positive response and requests for further videos/tutorials on technology from the general public, particularly those who are interested in learning technology education in Bangla. After receiving so many wonderful signals from the technology enthusiast, he began to consider how to create a skilled and healthy society in Bangladesh, where individuals of all ages and educational backgrounds may study technology for free, particularly in rural areas. <br /> <br />

                    After a two-year journey, codeinnovior now has a devoted, skilled, and experienced team of over 30 people ready to help learners achieve their ultimate goal. <br /> <br />

                    More tutorials on software development, networking, cyber security, the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, Block Chain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), creative designs, server administrations, digital marketing, data analysis, and codding for kids are now in the works for the channel where the offline & online training facilities are already going on. I hope we can give the next generation a brighter future.
